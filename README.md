# Gemini Data Wrangler

A lightweight data transformation web app powered by Gemini 3, supporting operations such as join, union, filter, and more. Built for the [Gemini 3 Hackathon](https://gemini3.devpost.com/).

## Features

- **AI-Powered Transformations**: Use natural language to transform your data with Gemini 3
- **Lightweight**: No heavy database - uses DuckDB WASM for in-browser processing
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Automatic chart generation based on your data
- **CSV Support**: Upload and work with CSV files directly in the browser

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd gemini-data-wrangler
```

2. Install all dependencies:
```bash
npm run install:all
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp server/.env.example server/.env
# Edit server/.env and add your GEMINI_API_KEY
```

4. Start the development servers:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start:
- Backend server on `http://localhost:3000`
- Frontend UI on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is taken)

### Usage

1. Open your browser to the frontend URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`)
2. Drag and drop a CSV file to upload it
3. Use natural language prompts to transform your data (e.g., "Filter for sales over $500", "Group by city and calculate totals")
4. View the results in both table and chart formats

## Supported Operations

The app currently supports the following data transformation operations through natural language:

- **Filtering**: Filter rows based on conditions
- **Grouping**: Group data by columns and aggregate
- **Joins**: Join multiple datasets (when multiple files are supported)
- **Aggregations**: Calculate sums, averages, counts, etc.
- **Sorting**: Order data by columns
- **Column Selection**: Select specific columns
- **Calculations**: Perform mathematical operations on columns

All operations are powered by DuckDB SQL generated by Gemini 3.

## Development

- `npm run dev` - Start both server and UI in development mode
- `npm run dev:server` - Start only the backend server
- `npm run dev:ui` - Start only the frontend UI
- `npm run build` - Build the frontend for production
